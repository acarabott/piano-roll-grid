# Piano Roll Layers

## What?

An alternative to having a fixed time grid on a piano roll. Instead you can lay down multiple grids with different subdivisions. New grids and new notes can be snapped to existing grids.

## Why?

Having a single fixed grid (usually 16th notes) makes the default very inviting and alternatives less accessible. Without a global default, you can explore other rhythms.
It also makes it easier to do things that a global grid makes difficult, like nested tuplets or starting a tuplet on the off-beat.
New tools make for new approaches!
